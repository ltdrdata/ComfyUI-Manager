Presently, the project is focused on the refinement of node categorization within a unified framework, as it is in the early stages of development. However, it has achieved functionality in a fundamental capacity. By processing a video through the Side-by-Side (SBS) node and applying Frame Delay to one of the inputs, it facilitates the creation of a stereopsis effect. This effect is compatible with any Virtual Reality headset that supports SBS video playback, offering a practical application in immersive media experiences."

The rationale behind the possibility of changing the size of the image in steps between the ranges of 576 and 1024, is the use of the greatest common denominator of these two numbers which is 64. SVD is lenient with resizing that adheres to this rule, so the chance of coherent video that is not the standard size of 576X1024 is greater. It is advisable to keep the value 1024 constant and play with the second size to maintain the stability of the result."
